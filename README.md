# PHPXC

CLI to manage PHP project creation ðŸ“¦

There are a lot of tools nowadays to setup your very first project 
such as configuring linters, static analyzers, testing, preparing composer configuration,
CI, CD, containerization...

PHPXC is a CLI that helps you manage all that stuff.

Highly inspired of [TSDX](https://tsdx.io/)
